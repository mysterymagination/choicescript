The penguin habitat is a fairly nice approximation of Antarctica, from whence your people hail. In addition to Mt. Snifflins with its many crags and crevasses, there is the icy and lovily relaxing Cocoon Lagoon, the harrowing Blustery Bluff, and the frolicsome Cozy Cove tucked in beside the lagoon.

    Climbing out of the lagoon, you shake yourself dry.    
Butterump is glancing at your shyly and looking swiftly away with a giggle every time you meet her gaze.  Flight is important, but it isn't everything... That's it!  The time has come: you should invite Butterump to play in one of the habitat's lovely locales.

        Butterump grins excitedly at the prospect of the challenging climb, and the two of you set off immediately.  At one point, near the summit, when your flippers were nearly frozen to your feathers, you nearly slipped into a crevasse.  You may well have met your end there, but Butterump caught you by the tail and hauled you (painfully) back to safety.  What with near death and all, the two of you bonded nicely over the adventure.  Not much chance to talk, though; it's a tough climb!  While you didn't learn much more about her hopes and dreams, you did learn she is apparently stronger than you (you never could manage a pull-up).  Could be a handy data point, and despite the chill you feel rather over-warm when you think about it.

        With a splish and a splash the two of you caper about in the lagoon.  She playfully spouts water at you and disappears beneath the surface in a flash when you attempt retaliation.  You notice appreciatively that her gloriously bulbous figure is pronounced by her slick feathers; you hope your own sodden visage is half as appealing to her... you have been lifting with the walrus lately.
