The penguin habitat is a fairly nice approximation of Antarctica, whence your people hail. In addition to Mt. Snifflins with its many crags and crevasses, there is the icy and lovily relaxing Cocoon Lagoon, the harrowing Blustery Bluff, and the frolicsome Cozy Cove tucked in beside the lagoon.

    Climbing out of the lagoon, you shake yourself dry.    
Butterump is glancing at you shyly and looking swiftly away with a giggle every time you meet her gaze.  Flight is important, but it isn't everything... That's it!  The time has come: you should invite Butterump to play in one of the habitat's lovely locales.

    Come to think of it, you noticed something shiny at the top of Mt. Snifflins just before you took your dive earlier; might be a good idea to ask her there and pick it up on the way.  Maybe it'd even make a nice gift?

        Butterump grins excitedly at the prospect of the challenging climb, and the two of you set off immediately.  At one point, near the summit, when your flippers were nearly frozen to your feathers, you nearly slipped into a crevasse.  You may well have met your end there, but Butterump caught you by the tail and hauled you (painfully) back to safety.  What with near death and all, the two of you bonded nicely over the adventure.  Not much chance to talk, though; it's a tough climb!  While you didn't learn much more about her hopes and dreams, you did learn she is apparently stronger than you (you never could manage a pull-up).  Could be a handy data point, and despite the chill you feel rather over-warm when you think about it.

        There's a lovely little glittering gold dragonfly barrette dusted with a rainbow of gemstones lying in the snow.

                Her eyes go wide at the oppulent gift and her white plumage goes pink.  "Thank you so much..."  She breathes, disbelieving.  She takes the barrette and clips it into the feathers near her temple.  Her plumage practically neon, she leans over and gives you a peck on the cheek.  The kissy kind.

        With a splish and a splash the two of you caper about in the lagoon.  She playfully spouts water at you and disappears beneath the surface in a flash when you attempt retaliation.  You notice appreciatively that her gloriously bulbous figure is pronounced by her slick feathers; you hope your own sodden visage is half as appealing to her... you have been lifting with the walrus lately.

    #Ask her to bask in the scenic view from Blustery Bluff
        The winds ruffle your feathers as you and Butterump sit in awed silence before the splendiforous sunset view.  A gaggle of penguin chicks rush by far below, frolicing, their downy feathers puffing up and making them all look like rolling fuzzballs; as the youngins play, Butterump lays her left flipper over your right and her head on your shoulder.

        Butterump's white plumage goes pink and her black plumage a deep scarlet as a powerful blush overwhelms her.  "I, uh, I don't know about that.  At least, maybe not yet?  I wanna get to know you better before, erm, 'getting cozy'."  She gives you a forced smile and rushes off.  Ooch.
