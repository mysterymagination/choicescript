Welcome to the zoo!  Specifically, the penguin habitat.

Things are cool here, literally and figuratively, but lately you've been feeling a little blue.  Your name is Puggelump, and you WILL be the first penguin ever to fly.

Butterump, your crushingly beloved crush, is watching you with interest.
There's an icy ramp nearby over the lagoon where your people frolic.  You could try your flipper-y wings at 'flying' off it to impress her.  Or, maybe it would be safer simply to wave?  What will you do?

*choice
  #Wave and nod your beak in an avian smile.
    She waves back merrily and all your white feathers flush red for a moment.
    *finish
  #Go for it -- let's fly right now!
    You race up to the top of Mt. Snifflins and dive towards the ramp, sliding along on your svelte belly feathers.  With a *WHOOSH* you sail off the end of the ramp and then splash down into the lagoon smooth as a polished beak.
    Butterump claps her flippers together enthusiastically and cheers you on.  That was spectacular, but it still wasn't flying...
