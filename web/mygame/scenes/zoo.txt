Well anyway, time to focus on flight!  As night falls and zoo surveillance drops to a skeleton crew, you prepare your kit.  You've spent the past weeks gathering detritus dropped or thrown by careless humans near enough to the penguin habitat to be reached by questing beaks.  You've managed to acquire a flashlight, a few scrunchies, and your prized possession: a meter of tough nylon cord, perfect for climbing.

Affixing the cord to the flashlight, you carefully huck it up and through the bars of the railing overlooking the penguin habitat.  With a little coaxing, you manage to get it firmly lodged on the far side of two bars, thus providing a solid anchor point.
